Project for creating notes into video and export after that in different format (HTML, Markdown, text) markup. Exported notes include a URL with time position and description of a fragment video. All notes were stored into IndexedDB storage. In interface users could make CRUD operations with notes. I didn't save data in external storage, all data saved into user browser. If user clean data cache all data lost.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: React with Material-UI components
- **Storage**: IndexedDB for client-side data persistence
- **Deployment**: Netlify for hosting
- **Export Formats**: HTML, Markdown, Plain Text

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete video notes
- Export notes in multiple formats (HTML, Markdown, text)
- Time-stamped video URLs for quick navigation
- Client-side storage using IndexedDB
- No external server dependencies

## Key Implementation Details

All data is stored locally in the user's browser using IndexedDB, providing a privacy-focused solution. The application allows users to annotate videos with time-stamped notes that can be exported for sharing or documentation purposes.
