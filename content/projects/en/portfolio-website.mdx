This enterprise-level website was built with a relentless focus on accessibility, ensuring seamless interaction for all users—including those relying on assistive technologies. Beyond baseline WCAG compliance, the development process incorporated real-user testing scenarios and screen reader optimization, supported by dedicated accessibility audits. The result was a frontend that not only met technical standards but delivered a polished, barrier-free experience.

## Technologies

The platform was built on Next.js with hybrid rendering (SSR/static) for performance, supported by Node.js backend modules and Drupal as a decoupled CMS. Infrastructure relied on GitLab CI/CD for atomic deployments, while accessibility was enforced through automated testing (Lighthouse, axe-core) and manual audits. The frontend design system was documented in Storybook, ensuring UI consistency across teams.

## Responsibilities

As Lead Frontend Developer, I owned the end-to-end delivery of the platform—from architecting CI/CD pipelines to coordinating API contracts with backend teams for seamless headless CMS integration. Beyond core development, I implemented tooling to enforce code quality standards and maintain design system consistency across environments. The role also involved writing server-side logic in Next.js to optimize frontend performance, alongside managing release cycles and documentation to ensure smooth deployments.

## Key Achievements

- Achieved WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with real-user testing
- Implemented automated accessibility audits in CI/CD pipeline
- Built scalable design system documented in Storybook
- Optimized performance with hybrid SSR/static rendering
