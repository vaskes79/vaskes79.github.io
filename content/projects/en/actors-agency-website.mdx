Developed an actor management dashboard enabling talent agents to securely input and manage performer profiles. The system leveraged MongoDB for structured data storage while offloading media assets to Cloudflare for optimized delivery. Each new actor submission automatically triggered a rebuild process, generating updated static content that deployed seamlessly to AWS S3 for instant availability.

Built with accessibility as a core principle, the dashboard implemented WCAG 2.1 AA standards throughout the admin interface. Conducted extensive screen reader testing using NVDA and VoiceOver, ensuring full keyboard navigation and proper ARIA labeling. Collaborated with accessibility experts to validate real-world usability, while integrating automated a11y checks into the CI/CD pipeline to maintain compliance across all updates.
